# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Energy monitoring devices collect consumption data but require accessible interfaces for users to:
- Track their energy usage patterns
- Identify high-consumption periods
- Monitor multiple devices/circuits
- Make informed decisions about energy consumption

## Problems It Solves
1. **Accessibility**: Mobile access to energy data anywhere, anytime
2. **Visualization**: Complex energy data presented in understandable charts
3. **Management**: Easy device configuration without technical expertise
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time awareness of energy consumption patterns

## How It Should Work

### User Journey - Viewing Consumption
1. User opens app
2. Sees current energy consumption dashboard
3. Can select date ranges to view historical data
4. Views consumption broken down by device/circuit
5. Analyzes trends through interactive charts

### User Journey - Device Configuration
1. User navigates to device settings
2. Selects device to configure
3. Updates settings (name, timezone, etc.)
4. Saves changes to database
5. Receives confirmation

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Simplicity**: Non-technical users can understand energy data
- **Speed**: Quick access to relevant information
- **Clarity**: Clear visualization of consumption patterns
- **Control**: Easy device management

### Design Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Optimized for phone screens
2. **Data-Driven**: Charts and visualizations prioritized
3. **Responsive**: Fast loading and smooth interactions
4. **Intuitive**: Minimal learning curve
